# QF (Quick Feedforward) Learning Framework

We propose Quick Feedforward (QF) Learning, a novel knowledge consolidation framework for transformer-based models that enables efficient transfer of instruction-derived knowledge into model weights through feedforward activationsâ€”without any gradient backpropagation. Unlike traditional fine-tuning, QF updates are computed in closed form, require minimal parameter modification, and preserve prior knowledge. Importantly, QF allows models to train and infer within the same runtime environment, making the process more resource-efficient and closely aligned with how the human brain operates. Code and models are open sourced on GitHub. I hope QF Learning inspires a more efficient and brain-like paradigm for AI systems.

## Overview

QF (Quick Feedforward) Learning is an innovative approach to quickly adapt large language models to new information without traditional fine-tuning. It uses matrix operations to compute updated weight matrices (`W_prime`) that can be applied during inference to incorporate new knowledge.


## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- PyTorch 2.3.1+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oxinnovate/QF
cd QF
